# Bike-Sharing-Analysis
This repository contains a Python script for analyzing bike sharing data using various libraries such as pandas, numpy, and Plotly. The script processes and visualizes data related to bike rides, including metrics like ride distances, ride counts by month, rideable types, customer segments, and popular starting stations.
## Description
Bike sharing systems are becoming increasingly popular as a sustainable and convenient mode of transportation. This script is designed to help analyze and visualize bike sharing data, providing insights into ride patterns, customer behavior, and station popularity.
## Methodology
The script reads and processes bike sharing data from CSV files. The data includes information about ride start and end times, rideable types, customer segments, station information, and more.
## Analysis
The following steps were followed:

* Merging monthly bike ride data into a single dataframe.
* Cleaning and formatting the data, and handling missing values and duplicates.
* Calculating ride distances in hours and creating new columns for ride months and days.
* Generating visualizations to analyze ride patterns, rideable types, customer segments, and popular starting stations.
